Herman Bergwerf
===============
**Welcome!** This webpage contains information about my expertise and
professional activity. I am specialized in solving difficult logical problems
and implementing the solutions in software. Visual communication plays a key
role in many of my projects, and I enjoy designing beautiful and innovative
interfaces. I like brainstorming together with a team to find the path towards a
good product, and to make technical descisions that are future-proof. I have an
academic background in biophysics, pure mathematics, and theoretical computer
science.

Technical skills
----------------

<br>

### Programming

<figure>

</figure>

I started programming over 10 years ago, and since then I learned to work with a
range of different languages, libraries, frameworks, tools, and stacks. Some of
my favorite programming languages are OCaml, Golang, TypeScript, Dart, and C.

<br>
<br>

### UI/UX Design

</figure>

I am a minimalist, and I like designing distinctive and functional interfaces
that are responsive, predictable, and easy to learn and understand. For one
project I developed a comprehensive WYSIWYG editor with a modular event handling
system to make sure that the code is easy to maintain and extend.

<br>
<br>

### 3D Graphics

<figure>

</figure>

I have worked on a number of projects that involved 3D rendering. From this I
learned the logic behind the OpenGL/WebGL API, how to accelerate rendering and
computation problems via custom shaders, and how to make 3D objects interactive
using libraries like `THREE.js`. Working on 3D graphics is always a treat.

<br>
<br>

### Machine Learning

<img style="width: 13em" class="frame" src="fig/nerve_segmentation_b.png">
</figure>

In my bachelor thesis I got hands-on experience with machine learning by
designing and training a *Deep Convolutional Neural Network* to perform image
segmentation of high resolution microscope scans. I also have experience testing
and applying existing machine learning models, which is often a very powerful
approach to build new solutions.

<br>
<br>

### Formal Verification

One of my academic specializations is *formal verification* using interactive
theorem provers. I developed various formalizations using the *Coq Proof
Assistant*. Developing formal proofs is very challenging, and requires careful
thinking about even the smallest logical inferences. Below is an overview of my
formalization projects.

Academic background
-------------------
<!--
In 2015 I started the *Nanobiology* Bachelor program at TU Delft. I was excited
to learn about the molecular machinery and laws of physics that make life
possible. While this fascination remains with me, I decided to move away from
the empirical sciences to study mathematics and logic.

I moved to Nijmegen where they offer a strongly theoretical computer science
track, including courses on Category Theory, Type Theory, Computability Theory,
and Automated Reasoning. My interest in mathematics increased, and I followed
courses about Axiomatic Set Theory, Model Theory, and Graph Theory.
