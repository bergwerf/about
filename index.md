Herman Bergwerf
===============
**Welcome!** This webpage contains information about my expertise and
professional activities. The main driving factor for me has always been solving
difficult problems, and making the solutions look as beautiful as possible.
I enjoy working with other skilled people, learning from them, and contributing
my own knowledge and insights. I have a strong theoretical background in
biophysics, mathematics, and computer science, and over the years I have gained
extensive experience with software development and programming.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Technical expertise
-------------------
I have affinity with challenges across the software stack, both high-level and
low-level. I like designing things, thinking about the interactions, and making
sure everything is implemented in a modular and efficient way.

<br>

### UI/UX Design

<img style="width: 15em" class="frame" src="fig/MolView_responsive_zoomed.png">
</figure>

When developing user interfaces I strive for perfection. I make sure things look
good on every screen, taking into account different sizes and resolutions. I
highly value simplicity, so I try to make things self explanatory using visual
metaphors users are familiar with. When necessary I use Inkscape to design
custom vector icons that blend in well with the rest of the design.

<br>

### Interactive Graphics

</figure>

Many of my projects have included interactive graphics, from a clickable world
map to an interactive 2D and 3D molecule editor. Developing graphics with
complex user interactions is one of my main strengths. In some cases I design a
custom event handling system to ensure predictable behavior, and to ease the
implemenation of new domain-specific features.

<br>

### Accelerated Graphics

Application performance should never stand in the way of the user, so when
needed I look for advanced ways to improve rendering efficiency. I have worked
with the OpenGL API, developed GLSL shaders, and implemented general-purpose GPU
computation. A good understanding of these technologies is very useful when
working with 3D graphics.

<br>

### Machine Learning

</figure>

I have experience developing deep learning networks, and using existing machine
learning solutions in Python. Jupyter Notebooks are an essential part of my
Python workflow. The machine learning world is very fast-paced, and novel
applications are published each day. Many existing solutions are just waiting
for new application contexts.

<br>

### Formal Verification

One of my academic specializations is *formal verification* using interactive
theorem provers. I primarily use the *Coq Proof Assistant*, using which I have
developed various formal theories. Developing formal proofs is very challenging,
and requires careful thinking about even the smallest logical inferences.
Below are some formalization projects I did in my spare time.

Academic background
-------------------
In 2015 I started the *Nanobiology* Bachelor program at TU Delft. I was excited
to learn about the molecular machinery and laws of physics that make life
possible. While this fascination remains with me, I decided to move away from
the empirical sciences to study mathematics and logic.

I moved to Nijmegen where they offer a strongly theoretical computer science
track, including courses on Category Theory, Type Theory, Computability Theory,
and Automated Reasoning. My interest in mathematics increased, and I followed
courses about Axiomatic Set Theory, Model Theory, and Graph Theory.
